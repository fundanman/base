For the `base` repo, there are a different ways to setup the project:

- [Gitpod (recommended)](#gitpod)
- [Local Development](#local-development)
- [Just send Markdown File](#send-markdown)

> 💡 Use the [Visual Styleguide](https://base.qap.dev/styleguide) to see what the markdown post will look like on the website.

> 💡 Use [how-to-make-a-post.md](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base/blob/main/_posts/2022-01-20-how-to-make-a-post.md) (and click `Raw`) to see what a raw markdown file looks like.

## Gitpod

We can share Gitpod workspaces so you don't have to do _any_ local setup. Spin up a pod and start coding!

> 💡 You will need a GitHub and Gitpod account (both free)

1. Once you have a GitHub and Gitpod account, join the [QAP Team](https://gitpod.io/teams/join?inviteId=6c67cd4b-d64e-4505-bf36-58599f224a04) on Gitpod

2. In the top left corner, select QAP and open the [Projects](https://gitpod.io/t/qap/projects) tab

3. Find the repo (`base` in this case) and click it's name

4. This will start a new workspace and open a browser tab with VS Code ready to go!

5. Make a branch, commit your changes, then submit a pull request

## Local Development

Fork the repo and create a new branch, then submit a pull request.

1. Fork it [https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base/fork](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base/fork)

2. Create your feature branch

   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```

3. Commit your changes

   ```sh
   git commit -am 'Add some feature'
   ```

4. Push to the branch

   ```sh
   git push origin my-new-feature
   ```

5. Create new Pull Request

## Send Markdown

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, coding, or just want the simplest option, you can send us a markdown file. A maintainer will review it, may ask for revisions, put it in the appropriate place, and submit it for you.

> Please send them to Carlos Kidman! Preferably in our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/qautah/shared_invite/zt-4cbb6q78-J8opsCMlPqOKdef42x9kUw) group 😎
